# The final data story
[Data Story on Shorthand](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/how-to-turn-the-tables-on-food-waste/index.html)

# Summary
### Introduction to the Project on Food Waste

#### Part I: Laying the Groundwork

The project begins with an overview pointing out the main aim: the need to sensitize readers about the magnitude of food wastage, the negative repercussions it has on society, and viable steps that can be taken by every individual towards its reduction, all of which are aimed at a sustainable future. The outline of the paper included the setup of the current food system capabilities, conflict introduced by the use of food waste, and strategies to resolve it effectively.

After outlining the backbone of the project, a mapped-out emotional journey was planned in order to take the audience through the story and really engage them in feeling and making the issue come alive.

I first sketched initial sketches for the visual representation of the key concepts of the discussion using Shorthand for narrative presentation, Tableau for data visualization, and Canva for crafting bespoke imagery.

Part I: Conclusion
The conclusion wrapped through giving the audience detailed steps, and enhanced by peer evaluation insights on how to come up with a feasible action plan to outline areas for enhancement in subsequent phases.

#### Part II: Broadening the Perspective with Data and Design

The first step was the creation of the data visualizations using Tableau, with an initial storyboard compiled within Shorthand, supported by the mood board to ensure that visual aspects were in line with the vibes that needed to be communicated through the presentation.

Evidently, it was meant to identify the target audience, and this actually laid the basis for drawing up the script on how to conduct comprehensive user research. The selection of the interviewees sought to pursue a broad spectrum of perspectives. In light of this, the following context-based issues are in focus.

- Context: Persuasion to take part in a discussion of their food consumption patterns.
- Audience: Perceptions of the likely interested demographic.
- Content: The impactfulness of the information conveyed.
- Key Takeaways: Elements that stood out or caused confusion.
- Visuals: The effectiveness of visual aids in clarifying the presented data.

The feedback from this stage was very important and has shown the critical improvements that should be made to Part III of the presentation, to improve the storytelling and understanding.

#### Part III: Refinement and Final Presentation

This was the final step that incorporated reflection on Part III with feedback from educators, peers, and interview feedback, focusing on some essential improvements.

- Adjust Visuals: Adjusting the Tableau charts to fit more comfortably in the Shorthand platform for better visual acuity.
- Story Structure: This is redoing the story structure to ensure it becomes more cohesive and makes logical sense.
- Chart Enhancement: Further refinement of the graphical elements to enhance their interpretability and visual engagement.

This phase aims to polish the project to ensure that the message on food waste reduction is compelling and clear, calling for individual and collective action towards a more sustainable and efficient food system.

# Changes made since Part II

Introduction

Reorganization of Storyboard for Improved Flow. Reordering the storyboard elements to make the narrative more coherent reflects peer recommendations, with greatest changes brought about by in composition of visual sequences to create a smoother order presenting the narrative in a more flowing, persuasive manner.

New background images were chosen, aimed at enhancing the appeal of the page. These are executed to make sure that every site may interest not only a person but support storytelling by the enrichment of visual depth of the story.

Text Box and Readability Improvement: The text boxes had their background darkened, hence increasing the reading ability of the information they contained. It was ensured that the text was more visible against vibrant backgrounds, and hence this change was made. ##### Subtitles and Data Contextualization
Adding subtitles and specifying data time frames made the charts clear in context. This approach provided a relatable data context and helped the audience feel a closer bond with the provided information.
Fine-tuned the legend; for example, by adding 'High' and 'Low' indicators, whereby it removed most of the feedback about the legend being unclear in the presentation of data. This further refined the interpretation of the visualizations and made them clear, thus creating a more intuitive interface for reading the trends presented in the data.

Alignment of the Color Scheme with the Mood Board
In the revised version, it involved revisiting the color scheme to make sure that it was in line with the mood board and that there was continuity in color, which forms a great aspect of visual unity. This was to be sure that not only did the project look good to the eyes, but it also made sense in relation to the tone of the storyline.
This was strategic in the way that it highlighted essential messages within the document's title. The takeaways were effectively highlighted and easily could have been what the reader noticed first.
The visuals were streamlined to communicate the key results directly and clearly. A special thanks to the student who helped simplify some of the more complex slides and even removed a redundant pie chart legend, making the remaining information more manageable and interesting.

Conclusion
All these revisions taken together have really improved effective communication of the project. It underscores the power of feedback and the readiness to be adaptableâ€”both crucial elements in turning great ideas into great execution. This process of refinement has yielded an improvement not just in quality, both visual and narrative, but also made this project an even more potent tool in regards to engagement and information dissemination.
