# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at Carnegie Mellon University!

# About me
- My name is Sharvari Yeole, I am from India. 
- My pronouns are She/Her.
- I am a Master's student pursuing Management of Information Systems.
- I really like the idea of presenting millions of rows of data into a colourful picture.
- My journey into the world of data visualization began with a simple realization: data is only as valuable as the story it tells. 
- It's not just about numbers; it's about painting a narrative that inspires action
- My aim is to weave stories that transform data from dry facts into genuinely engaging experiences


# What I hope to learn 
1. Develop a comprehensive understanding of data visualization principles, focusing on color theory, layout, and the selection of appropriate 
   visualization types for various datasets
2. Enhance presentation skills, ensuring that narratives are not only informative but also engaging, making complex data easily understandable 
   for various stakeholders.
3. Develop important data analysis skills, including spotting biases and misrepresentations.
