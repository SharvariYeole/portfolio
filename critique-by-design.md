# Critique by Design

## Step one : Choose a data visualization from MakeoverMonday

I recently had the opportunity to read about Cynthia Carroll, she served as the Chief Executive Officer of Anglo American plc, one of the world's largest mining companies, from 2007 to 2013 During her tenure, she made notable changes, focusing on improving safety standards, which led to a substantial reduction in fatalities and injuries in the company's operations Her leadership was marked by a strong emphasis on ethical practices and corporate social responsibility, seeking to enhance the company's environmental and social impact

I also watched a movie named Mission Raniganj based  on the incident of the Raniganj Coalfields Collapse of 1989 which happened in West Bengal. It depicts the biography Jaswant Singh Gill who saved the lives of many miners after the collapse. 

While I was browsing through the MakeoverMonday website I came across this article titled "Indian Coal Mine Location and Production" which intrigued me.

The article is published [here](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2633-1357/abdbbb)
