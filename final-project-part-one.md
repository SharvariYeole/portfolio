# Topic: How to Turn the Tables on Food Waste: A Global Feast for Thought 

# Outline
### High Level Summary
The global food system can feed billions of people but also causes a lot of food waste. This waste harms the environment, costs a lot of money, and makes food scarcity worse. By understanding and dealing with the reasons behind food waste, we can develop better ways to consume food, reduce harm to the environment, and use resources more wisely.
 
### Reader's Objective
As a reader, I want to understand the scale of food wastage, its impacts, and practical ways to contribute to its reduction, aiming for a sustainable future. By learning about effective strategies for minimizing food waste at the individual, community, and policy levels, I can make informed decisions that contribute to a more efficient and ethical food system.

### Project Structure
Setup: The modern food system is a marvel of logistics and production, capable of generating abundant food supplies that reach markets across the globe, ensuring variety and availability like never before.

Conflict: Despite these advancements, a significant portion of this food never reaches consumers, leading to environmental, economic, and social issues. Food wastage occurs at multiple points in the supply chain, from agricultural production to household consumption, each contributing to the problem in unique ways.

Resolution: By adopting measures such as improving supply chain efficiencies, enforcing better food handling practices, educating consumers, and implementing innovative solutions to redistribute excess food, significant strides can be made in reducing food wastage. Personal actions like planning purchases, understanding food labels, and creative re-use of leftovers are also crucial steps toward this goal.

### Setup: Introducing the Global Food Waste Challenge

- **Context and Magnitude of the Problem**: Begin by presenting the global scale of food waste, highlighting how a significant portion of food produced worldwide is never consumed. Introduce key statistics to illustrate the extent of food waste from production to consumption across various regions.
- **Underlying Causes**: Discuss the multi-faceted reasons behind food waste, including agricultural practices, supply chain inefficiencies, retail and restaurant waste, and consumer behavior. This part sets the stage by providing a broad understanding of how and why food waste occurs at different stages of the food system.
- **Environmental, Economic, and Social Impacts**: Briefly outline the consequences of food waste, including its contribution to greenhouse gas emissions, wasted resources (like water and land), economic losses for producers and consumers, and missed opportunities to address food insecurity.

### Conflict: The Challenges in Addressing Food Waste

- **Complexity of the Food Supply Chain**: Delve into the complexities of reducing food waste within the global food supply chain, from harvest and post-harvest losses in agricultural settings to issues in distribution, retail, and consumption.
- **Behavioral and Policy Barriers**: Explore the challenges related to changing consumer behavior, such as the tendency to overbuy and misunderstandings about food expiration dates, as well as the need for more supportive policies and infrastructure to facilitate food waste reduction.
- **Technological and Logistical Limitations**: Highlight the limitations in current technologies for food preservation, distribution, and recycling, as well as the logistical challenges in connecting surplus food with those in need.

### Resolution: Strategies and Solutions for Reducing Food Waste

- **Innovations and Best Practices**: Present innovative technologies, practices, and policies that have been successful in reducing food waste at different points in the food supply chain, such as precision farming, improved food storage solutions, food sharing platforms, and policies that encourage donation over disposal.
- **Community and Individual Actions**: Emphasize the role of communities and individuals in reducing food waste, including adopting more mindful consumption habits, participating in composting programs, and supporting initiatives that redistribute food to those in need.
- **Call to Action for Collective Effort**: Conclude with a strong call to action, urging stakeholders at all levels—from policymakers and industry leaders to consumers and communities—to collaborate in reducing food waste. Highlight the importance of education, policy change, and innovation in creating a more sustainable food system.

# The data


| Name           | URL                                              | Description |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ----------- |
| ReFED          | [https://refed.org/](https://refed.org/)         | A centralized repository of information built with data from more than 50 public and proprietary datasets and providing granular estimates of how much food goes uneaten in the U.S., why it's happening, and where it goes. |
| FAO            | [https://www.fao.org/platform-food-loss-waste/flw-data/user-guide/en](https://www.fao.org/platform-food-loss-waste/flw-data/user-guide/en) | The database contains data and information from openly accessible databases, reports and studies measuring food loss and waste across food products, stages of the value chain, and geographical areas. |
| OCED           | [https://shorturl.at/ehkCQ](https://shorturl.at/ehkCQ) | The OECD food waste dataset is a compilation to food loss and food waste for 32 countries. The period covered may vary across different countries depending on data availability(globally ranging from 1993 to 2013). |
| Global SDG Database | [https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/dataportal](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/dataportal) | The database contains data on the global Sustainable Development Goal indicators used in the Sustainable Development Goals Report 2018, and includes country-level data as well as regional and global aggregates |



# Method and medium
I plan to use the following tools for my final Project:
1. Tableau for Vizualizations
2. Figma for Wireframing
3. Shorthand for final story narrative
4. Canva to create any other custom visual


# In Class Peer Feedback
- Is the Data confined to the US or is it Global?
- Add more infographics that are easier to understand like how many families can be fed by the amount of food wasted 
- The environmental impact section doesn't feel as connected to the story 

### Plans going forward:
Add more infographics, and research the environmental impact section to better connect with the story
