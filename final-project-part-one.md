# Topic: How to Turn the Tables on Food Waste: A Global Feast for Thought 

# Outline
### High Level Summary
The global food system can feed billions of people but also causes a lot of food waste. This waste harms the environment, costs a lot of money, and makes food scarcity worse. By understanding and dealing with the reasons behind food waste, we can develop better ways to consume food, reduce harm to the environment, and use resources more wisely.
 
### Reader's Objective
As a reader, I want to understand the scale of food wastage, its impacts, and practical ways to contribute to its reduction, aiming for a sustainable future. By learning about effective strategies for minimizing food waste at the individual, community, and policy levels, I can make informed decisions that contribute to a more efficient and ethical food system.

### Project Structure
Setup: The modern food system is a marvel of logistics and production, capable of generating abundant food supplies that reach markets across the globe, ensuring variety and availability like never before.

Conflict: Despite these advancements, a significant portion of this food never reaches consumers, leading to environmental, economic, and social issues. Food wastage occurs at multiple points in the supply chain, from agricultural production to household consumption, each contributing to the problem in unique ways.

Resolution: By adopting measures such as improving supply chain efficiencies, enforcing better food handling practices, educating consumers, and implementing innovative solutions to redistribute excess food, significant strides can be made in reducing food wastage. Personal actions like planning purchases, understanding food labels, and creative re-use of leftovers are also crucial steps toward this goal.
